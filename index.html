      <h3><b>About Orphanage</b></h3><br><br>

      <p>An orphanage is a place where children without parents are cared for and housed. ...
         An orphanage is an institution that takes care of orphans. <br>
         An orphanage will care for tiny babies and also older children without parents.
         Orphanages care for children until they can be placed in homes and adopted.
       Devastated by the loss of their unborn baby, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) decide to adopt a child. At the orphanage, both feel drawn to a little girl (Isabelle Fuhrman) named Esther, and soon the couple take their new daughter home. But when a dangerous series of events unfolds, Kate begins to suspect that there is something evil lurking behind the child's angelic exterior.</p><br>
